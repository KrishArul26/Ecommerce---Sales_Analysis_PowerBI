<h2 align="center"> Ecommerce Sales Data Analysis Using Power-BI</h2>

<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>

<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> In the wake of the Internet revolution, people now prefer to shop online rather than buying directly from their local stores. Therefore, e-commerce data needs to be analysed to determine the full benefit of the information about the business and make appropriate decisions. So here I have used e-commerce data which includes various characteristics like region, product type, sales and price etc. So this data was interrogated by Power-Bi and finally a dashboard was created.
